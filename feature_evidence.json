      "featureTitle": "In ResourcesPage.tsx, when the user submits a location (zip code, city name like 'Miami', or any address) via the manual text input in the LocationBar, use the browser's native fetch to call a free geocoding API (e.g., Nominatim/OpenStreetMap at https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search) to resolve the entered text into latitude/longitude coordinates. Store those resolved coordinates as the active location context so the existing proximity-sort logic can rank resources by distance from those coordinates.",
