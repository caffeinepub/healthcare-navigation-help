  "summary": "The diff implements the three requested requirements (REQ-22, REQ-23, REQ-24) with good coverage. REQ-22 geocoding via Nominatim is fully implemented in LocationBar.tsx with error handling and geolocation preservation. REQ-23 lat/lng fields are added to both backend/main.mo and the frontend fallback data. REQ-24 haversine function and coordinate-based sorting are implemented in locationUtils.ts, and distance labels are shown in ResourceDirectoryItem.tsx. One minor gap exists: the backend initialization data only includes lat/lng for a single resource entry, while the requirement states all existing sample resource entries should have lat/lng populated.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "All existing sample resource entries in backend initialization data have lat/lng values populated.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo initializeData() function only initializes one community resource ('Leominster Community Medical Center') with lat/lng. The frontend fallback has 8 entries with coordinates, but the backend initialization data only shows one resource entry. The requirement states all existing sample resource entries in backend initialization data should have lat/lng populated.",
