  "summary": "The diff implements all 11 requirements with a comprehensive full-stack healthcare navigation web app. The implementation covers hero section, find care, insurance glossary, appointment checklist, medical bill guide, financial assistance, community resources, guided journeys, educational workshops, navigation bar/about page, and visual theming. A few specific acceptance criteria items show weak or unclear evidence due to file truncation, but overall coverage appears high. Minor gaps are noted around explicit seeding minimums (15 insurance terms, 10 checklist items, 6 community resources, 4+ workshops, 5+ assistance programs) since the backend file was truncated after showing only one of each, and the how-to-apply guidance field is missing from AssistanceProgram.",
