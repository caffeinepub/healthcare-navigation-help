# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a community healthcare navigation web app serving Leominster, MA and surrounding Massachusetts communities, helping users find affordable care, understand insurance, prepare for visits, decode medical bills, and access financial assistance — all using seeded static data with a warm, welcoming visual design.

**Planned changes:**
- Hero/Home section with mission statement ("No one should miss medical care because the system is confusing, overwhelming, or hard to afford") and CTAs linking to key sections
- "Find Affordable Care" resource finder with categorized care types (urgent, routine, specialist, community health), descriptions, and guidance; seeded backend data scoped to Leominster, MA area
- Insurance Terms & Coverage Explainer with a searchable glossary of at least 15 plain-language insurance terms stored in the backend
- Interactive Appointment Preparation Checklist with 10+ items grouped by category (documents, questions, advocacy), checkboxes, progress indicator, and print/copy support
- Medical Bill Guide presenting 4+ topics (reading a bill, spotting errors, requesting itemization, payment plans) in step-by-step/accordion format with a patient-rights callout
- Financial Assistance Programs finder listing 5+ programs (e.g., MassHealth, Health Safety Net, hospital charity care) with eligibility summaries and apply guidance; filterable by type
- Community Resource Map directory listing 6+ local resources (community health centers, free clinics, support services) with name, type, location, and contact info; filterable by service type
- Step-by-Step Navigation Tools with 3+ guided journey flows (e.g., "I need care but have no insurance"), each with 4–7 steps, forward/backward navigation, and progress tracking
- Educational Resources & Workshops section with cards organized by category (guides, workshops, advocacy skills); 4+ entries seeded in the backend
- Persistent responsive navigation bar linking to all major sections, plus an About/Vision page covering mission, audience, service area, and expansion vision
- Site-wide warm, community-oriented visual theme: teal-green primary, warm white background, clean readable typography (min 16px body), applied consistently across all pages and components
