It helps users find affordable care, understand insurance, prepare for appointments, manage medical bills, access financial assistance programs, and build healthcare advocacy skills. The vision is to expand from local to national/global impact.",

    "Program focuses on real-life navigation skills and actionable tools, not just informational content",
    "Vision includes scalability from local/regional to national and global reach",
    "Community resource finder should support geolocation (with user permission) and manual zip code/address input to find nearby resources, replacing the hardcoded Leominster, MA location",
    "Location-based resource search should return real nearby places relevant to the user's entered location (city, zip, or address), not just filter hardcoded local data",
    "App should use general/universal language throughout — avoid hardcoding references to Leominster, MA or Massachusetts in UI text, descriptions, and informational content"
